    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>The overall goal of our project is creating a crypto exchange website that can send money 
anywhere in the world within minutes. The exchange will be based on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The exchange will allow users to connect to their MetaMask wallet and send Ethereum to other 
Ethereum wallets. The objective of the exchange is to eliminate the middleman such as bank 
system to send a user's money.</p>
